Short explanation if you end up here for some weird reason.

We wanted the list of Debian package versions identified by Debian as
fixing vulnerabilities.
This very dirty hack parses (very poorly) the Debian OVAL file and turns
(some of) the data into yummy JSON.

The resulting file cannot in any way be treated as an authorative or
reliable source of information.
Neither my employers, present, past or future, nor I, will ever take any
responsibility for any direct or indirect use of this tool.
